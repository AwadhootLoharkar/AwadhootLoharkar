<h2 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h2>

My name is Awadhoot Loharkar.  
I am originally from India and currently pursuing my Master's in Quantum Technologies and Engineering at UniversitÃ© de Bourgogne, Dijon, France, under the Erasmus Mundus scholarship (QuanTEEM).  
I am passionate about quantum physics, engineering, and developing innovative solutions in semi-autonomous drones and vehicles.

Check out my work on Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) for option pricing using Qiskit: [Awadhoot's QFT Project](https://github.com/awadhootloharkar/qft-option-pricing). *(Update this link with your actual project link once ready.)*

Outside of academics, I enjoy photography, traveling, and playing the ukulele to sing songs by artists like KK, Mustafa Zahid, and Atif Aslam. I also aim to maintain a fitness routine focused on muscle gain.
